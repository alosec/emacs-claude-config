# Product Context: Claude Code Powered Emacs

## Vision
Create the ultimate AI-assisted development environment by deeply integrating Claude Code with Emacs, enabling seamless context switching between projects, sessions, and AI interactions.

## Problem Statement
- **Context Switching**: Developers lose context when switching between projects, Claude sessions, and different work streams
- **Session Management**: Claude Code sessions exist in isolation without connection to development workspace
- **Layout Persistence**: Window configurations and frame layouts are lost across sessions
- **AI Integration**: AI assistance isn't deeply integrated into the development workflow

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User (You)
**Role**: Developer/Power User configuring personal development environment
**Goals**:
- Maintain deep context across multiple projects and AI sessions
- Seamlessly integrate AI assistance into development workflow
- Preserve work state across emacs sessions and system restarts
- Organize complex projects with multiple claude-code instances

### Workflow Patterns
1. **Project Context**: Each project has associated claude-code sessions
2. **Frame Association**: Frames represent work contexts with specific claude sessions
3. **Layout Persistence**: Window configurations saved per project/session
4. **Session Continuity**: Resume work exactly where left off

## Value Proposition
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Direct frame-to-session relationships eliminate navigation overhead
- **Enhanced Productivity**: AI assistance deeply integrated into development workflow
- **State Preservation**: Never lose work context across sessions
- **Organized Complexity**: Manage multiple projects and AI sessions without confusion

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to associate frames with specific claude-code sessions so I can maintain focused work contexts
- As a developer, I want to save and restore window layouts so I can resume work exactly where I left off
- As a developer, I want to switch between project contexts without losing AI conversation history
- As a developer, I want the AI to understand my project structure and current work context automatically
