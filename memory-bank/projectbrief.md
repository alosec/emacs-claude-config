# Project Brief: Emacs Configuration as Claude Code Powered Editor

## Project Overview
Transform personal Emacs configuration into a sophisticated Claude Code powered development environment with integrated session management, frame-to-session relationships, and intelligent layout management.

## Core Requirements
1. **Version Control**: Full git integration for emacs configuration
2. **Memory Bank**: Structured documentation following Claude Code patterns
3. **Session Management**: Relate emacs frames to specific claude-code sessions
4. **Layout System**: Intelligent window/frame management for claude-code workflows
5. **Integration**: Seamless claude-code.el integration with existing configuration

## Current State
- Sophisticated emacs configuration with org-super-agenda (3 views)
- Claude-code.el already integrated and configured
- Modular org configuration in lisp/ directory
- Git repository initialized with recent commits
- Helm, projectile, and advanced navigation configured

## Success Criteria
- Frames can be associated with specific claude-code sessions
- Layout management preserves work contexts across sessions
- Memory bank provides complete project understanding
- Version control tracks all configuration changes
- Integration feels natural and enhances existing workflows

## Key Components
- **claude-code.el**: Already configured with session management
- **Frame management**: New system for frame-to-session relationships
- **Layout persistence**: Save/restore window configurations
- **Memory bank**: Complete documentation system
- **Configuration modularity**: Maintain clean, organized structure
